# Welcome

blueCFD®-Core is an open source project provided by [FSD Portugal](https://fsdynamics.eu/).

This project provides source code and high quality builds of OpenFOAM® technology
and related open source projects, as unofficial ports for up-to-date 64 bit Windows
10 and 11 (older versions of blueCFD-Core will work on older versions of Windows).

Additional tweaks, executables and scripts are also provided, in order to
maintain usability when working within Microsoft Windows Operating Systems.

The source code for the patched versions are tracked in the
[blueCFD project at Github](http://github.com/blueCFD).

This project is in continuous development, so keep track of how it is evolving
at the following locations:

 * [FSD Portugal's Twitter](https://twitter.com/bluecapept)

**Note**: Contributions and collaboration are very much welcome, but we are
still working on the releases that we have planned. Please follow our news
feeds to know when we start accepting contributions.

   is responsible for the development and maintenance of the blueCFD®-Core
   project.

 * blueCFD® is a [registered trade mark](http://bluecfd.com/trademark) of

   the maintenance overhead associated to supporting closed-source operating
   systems.
