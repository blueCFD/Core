# Welcome

blueCFD®-Core is an open source project provided by [FSD blueCAPE Lda](http://www.bluecape.com.pt).

This project provides source code and high quality builds of OpenFOAM® technology
and related open source projects, as unofficial ports for up-to-date 64 bit Windows
10 and 11 (older versions of blueCFD-Core will work on older versions of Windows).

Additional tweaks, executables and scripts are also provided, in order to
maintain usability when working within Microsoft Windows Operating Systems.

The source code for the patched versions are tracked in the
[blueCFD project at Github](http://github.com/blueCFD).

This project is in continuous development, so keep track of how it is evolving
at the following locations:

 * [Project News]({{ site.baseurl }}/News)
 * [FSD blueCAPE's Twitter](https://twitter.com/bluecapept)

**Note**: Contributions and collaboration are very much welcome, but we are
still working on the releases that we have planned. Please follow our news
feeds to know when we start accepting contributions.

# Disclaimers

 * [FSD blueCAPE](http://bluecape.com.pt) is responsible for the development and
   maintenance of the blueCFD®-Core project.

 * blueCFD® is a [registered trade mark](http://bluecfd.com/trademark) of
   FSD blueCAPE Lda.

 * This offering is not approved or endorsed by [OpenCFD Limited](http://www.openfoam.com),
   producer and distributor of the OpenFOAM software via www.openfoam.com and owner of the
   OPENFOAM® and OpenCFD® trade marks.

 * FSD blueCAPE Lda is a contributor to the [OpenFOAM Foundation](http://openfoam.org),
   but the majority of the specific modifications needed in the source code
   for running OpenFOAM natively on Windows, will not be accepted in
   the official releases of OpenFOAM by the OpenFOAM Foundation, mostly due to
   the maintenance overhead associated to supporting closed-source operating
   systems.
