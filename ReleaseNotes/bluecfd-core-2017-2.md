## Software provided with installers

Here is listed what software and respective versions are provided inside the
binary installers, namely:

  * [blueCFD-Core-2017-2-win64-setup.exe](https://github.com/blueCFD/Core/releases/tag/blueCFD-Core-2017-2)

      * [MSys2](https://msys2.github.io/) x86_64, from 2018-02-20.
      We selected [MSys2](https://msys2.github.io/) because it provides an open
      source software development infrastructure and is more up-to-date than
      the original MSys project. There are several pre-installed packages,
      including:
          * CMake 3.9.2
          * GCC 7.2.0
          * GDB 8.0.1

          * Evince 3.26.0
          * Ghostcript 9.21
          * Many other packages are already pre-installed. To get a full list
          after installation, run in MSys2: `pacman -Q`

      * OpenFOAM 5.x, commit
      [19576d14a099e0b21e88a22b57fcf027d00ffa50](https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-5.x/commits/19576d14a099e0b21e88a22b57fcf027d00ffa50),

          * Using the pre-built one from the [ParaView.org website](https://www.paraview.org/download/).
          * This needs MS-MPI to be installed in your system.

      is provided as an optional alternative to 7.1 and will only be installed

## Cumulative changes and notes

This release provides the following changes relative to the
[previous version of blueCFD-Core](bluecfd-core-2017-1):

1. Sync up branch blueCFD-Core-5.x with upstream OpenFOAM 5.x:

    * From OpenFOAM-5.x repository, up to commit
      `19576d14a099e0b21e88a22b57fcf027d00ffa50`, 2018-02-26 14:12:48.

    * From ThirdParty-5.x repository, up to commit
      `a807587a7babd4d03b62794b26e5ef4105301416`, 2018-02-10 17:16:35.

2. Upgrade to latest Gnuplot on MSys2 so that it's possible to generate plots
   of type PNG and JPEG, even though it still has a bug when using the `help`
   command. `wgnuplot` is now possible to be used as well. See Issue
   [#78](https://github.com/blueCFD/Core/issues/78) for more details.

3. Ghostscript 9.21 and Evince 3.26.0 from MSys2 have also been installed, to
   make it easier to create and open PS, EPS and PDF files directly from the
   command line (see also Issue [#78](https://github.com/blueCFD/Core/issues/78)).

4. Removed our old - and now unused - script `bin/fixPatchExeNames`.

5. Replaced all symbolic linked scripts in the folder `bin` for the real ones,
   given that this feature is not properly supported on Windows.

6. Applied a bug fix that affected some installations of blueCFD-Core 2017,
   where Meld would not launch due to the lack of the highlight description
   files. See Issue [#83](https://github.com/blueCFD/Core/issues/83) for more
   details.

7. Minor change made to
   `$FOAM_SRC/OpenFOAM/db/dynamicLibrary/dynamicCode/dynamicCode.C`, so that
   the absolute path is used instead of the relative path for the binaries that
   are built on-the-fly. This was needed due to the 260 maximum character path
   for file/folder paths on Windows.
