title: Funding for the blueCFD-Core project
---


As you may know, blueCFD-Core has reached thousands of people around the world,
delivering a convenient, high quality and easy to use Windows port of OpenFOAM.
As OpenFOAM evolves, this need remains as pressing as ever. 

Since we started the project, we have been thrilled and thankful to assist the
OpenFOAM community in this way. 

In this spirit, and since OpenFOAM continually matures, it is natural
that blueCFD-Core follows suit. So, to ensure blueCFD-Core's future, it is time
to step-up a notch and kindly request your participation. In return, we are happy
to recognize your company’s involvement, similarly to the current sponsors on
the project’s webpage.

Essentially, we would like to invite you to support our 2022 Support Drive.

If you are inclined to assess this proposition, please read on as we
have more details on what your support can enable in blueCFD-Core.

**We envision three participation levels:**

  * Sponsor, if you want to help steer the project by contributing development
    plans and jointly or exclusively fund them (>5000$US). Your company’s name
    and logo will appear prominently on the project’s webpage, as a Sponsor.

  * Benefactor, if you benefit from blueCFD-Core at your company and would like
    to shore up its future availability (>500$US). Your company’s name and logo
    will appear on the project’s webpage as a Benefactor.

  * Patron, if you are an individual or a small company and just want to say
    thank you, with a tip (any amount). You will be recognized by name/alias.

**Note:** If you need an invoice or prefer to do a bank transfer, please contact
us at [donate@bluecfd.com](mailto:donate@bluecfd.com). If you want to provide further input for the project
and ideas, please note that we have a dedicated
[place for this](https://github.com/blueCFD/Core/discussions/categories/ideas).
