# Mission Statement

  1. The primary objective of the blueCFD-Core project is to bring OpenFOAM
  technology to run natively in Microsoft Windows, as an open source
  collaboration with and for these communities.

  2. Contributions and collaboration are very much welcome and are open to
  anyone.

  3. Any source code changes will be made public at the
  [blueCFD project page](https://github.com/blueCFD/), with associated
  documentation provided at or linked from the
  [User Guides]({{ site.baseurl }}/UserGuide) page.

  4. Changes made to the project's supported ports, will be submitted to the
  respective upstream project.

  5. Documentation will be made as open as possible, with the primary
  target located at [openfoamwiki.net](https://openfoamwiki.net).
  The local [User Guides]({{ site.baseurl }}/UserGuide) page will act as auxiliary
  documentation.


# Vision

Beyond the mission statement, this project aims to achieve the following goals:

  1. Be able to compile from source code and install OpenFOAM technology on
  Microsoft Windows as easily as done on Linux Distributions. This is primarily
  done by relying on MSys2 as a development infrastructure. Resulting binaries
  can be used independently from MSys2.

  2. Provide an easy way to install pre-built binaries, either through
  one-click installers or through MSys2 package manager.

  3. Remove hurdles towards making OpenFOAM technology more common on Windows,
  just as in any Linux Distribution.

  4. To collaborate with the upstream projects for which porting efforts have
  been made, so that the efforts for the blueCFD-Core project are reduced to
  simple maintenance or even to eliminate the need for any additional porting
  efforts.

  5. To promote and embrace community efforts, as well as to respect original
  authorship and copyrights.

  6. To improve quality and performance.


# History

blueCFD速 product/service was first launched by blueCAPE in 11th of November of 2009.
It was re-branded in November 2013 to blueCFD-Core, as blueCAPE's
offerings had expanded into more products and services.

On the 15th of December 2011, the blueCFD-SingleCore project had been released,
with the objective to provide the source code and a basic feature set of
blueCFD-Core, without MSys and MPI support.

blueCFD速 is registered as a trade mark by blueCAPE Lda, since October 2012.

In November 2013, with blueCAPE's launch of blueCFD速-AIR, the original blueCFD
was re-branded to blueCFD速-Core.

On the 22nd of March 2016, blueCAPE released blueCFD-Core 2.3-1 freely. It was
soon followed on the 4th of August 2016 with the release of
blueCFD-Core 2016-1, as new generation for this project.

blueCFD(-Core) was originally developed at blueCAPE in 2009 to bring and share
our own cross-compilations of OpenFOAM to the scientific and engineering community,
namely those who are bound to Microsoft's Windows Operating System. We had a
need for having OpenFOAM working in Windows and the tutorials for
cross-compiling OpenFOAM 1.4.1 and 1.5.0 in Linux for Windows already existed,
provided by [Symscape](https://www.symscape.com).

At the time of the first release of blueCFD, Symscape had already launched their
OpenFlow product (which provided their own port), but since our builds are somewhat
different, we believed that some competition would also be healthy.

Originally, a similar path was taken to what was done at Symscape, namely to publish the
changes to OpenFOAM as public patches, but we instead made them public and fairly detailed
at [openfoamwiki.net](https://openfoamwiki.net). The entry point for those wiki pages
is the following wiki page:
[Tip Cross Compiling OpenFOAM in Linux For Windows with MinGW](https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Installation/Windows/Outdated/Tip_Cross_Compiling_OpenFOAM_in_Linux_For_Windows_with_MinGW)

As time passed by, more and more solutions were made available with various
degrees of support and price, where a list is maintained on the wiki page
[Windows at openfoamwiki.net](https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Windows).

In 2015, a decision at blueCAPE was made to expand the already existing public
porting effort in [blueCFD project at Github](https://github.com/blueCFD)
to its full extent. This decision came to fruition on August 2016, when it was
finally made public.

In February 2017, blueCAPE Lda was renamed to [FSD blueCAPE Lda](https://joomla.bluecape.com.pt/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=92&Itemid=2),
after being acquired by [FS Dynamics](https://fsdynamics.se/), without affecting
the blueCFD-Core project.
