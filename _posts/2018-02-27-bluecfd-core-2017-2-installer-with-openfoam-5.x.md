Today we release the culmination of all of the bug fixes done since the last post,
namely [replying and fixing bug reports](https://github.com/blueCFD/Core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed),
synchronizing the
[blueCFD-Core-5.x branch with OpenFOAM-5.x](https://github.com/blueCFD/OpenFOAM-dev/tree/blueCFD-Core-5.x)
and [writing FAQ entries]({{ site.baseurl }}/FAQ/).

blueCFD-Core 2017-2 is a bug fix release, along with a
synchronization with all of the bug fixes available in
[OpenFOAM 5.x](https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-5.x/). A few fixes and
additions were made for the third-party software (see the 
[release notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/ReleaseNotes/bluecfd-core-2017-2)).

Released elements are:

At the time of this release, there were several tasks still open, as it can be 
seen on the [milestone blueCFD-Core 2017-2](https://github.com/blueCFD/Core/milestone/4)
page, which will be addressed as soon as possible, in association with this
milestone.

As mentioned above, the development infrastructure is based on
[MSys2](https://msys2.github.io/) and instructions for developing in a clean
installation of MSys2 will be provided at [openfoamwiki.net](https://openfoamwiki.net),
once we are able to sort out the tasks left for this
[milestone](https://github.com/blueCFD/Core/milestone/4).
